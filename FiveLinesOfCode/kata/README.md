# five-lines

In this kata your task is to refactor the code for a small game. When finished it should be easy to add new tile types, or make the key draw as a circle, so we can easily distinguish it from the lock.

The code already abides by the most common principles "Don't Repeat Yourself", "Keep It Simple, Stupid", and there are only very few magic literals. There are no poorly structured nor deeply nested `if`s.

This is _not_ an easy exercise.

# About the Game

In the game, you are a red square and have to get the box (brown) to the lower right corner. Obstacles include falling stones (blue), walls (gray), and a lock (yellow, right) that can be unlocked with the key (yellow, left). You can push one stone or box at a time, and only if it is not falling. The flux (greenish) holds up boxes and stones but can be 'eaten' by the player.

# How to Build It

Assuming that you have the Typescript compiler installed: Open a terminal in this directory, then run `tsc`. There should now be a `index.js` file in this directory.

# How to Run It

To run the game you need to first build it, see above. Then simply open `index.html` in a browser. Use the arrows to move the player.
